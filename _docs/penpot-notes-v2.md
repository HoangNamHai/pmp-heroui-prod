Using AI Coding agent working with Penpot is difficult, the agent must use Penpot MCP to work with Penpot.
The MCP has several limitation in functions, it also have to take screenshots of the shape in MCP to visually check for information.
Check `_docs/penpot-notes.md` for more details.

I am thinking of using a YAML or markdown to represent the design I want to create then sync that to Penpot. Hopefully this way will help creating design in penpot more stable, less error. What do you think?
